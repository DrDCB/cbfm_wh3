missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_qb_gotrek_felix_chaos_katarin	Geheimnistag, or the Floating Holiday as it is known among citizens of the Empire, marks that rarest of occasions: when both the twin moons of Morrslieb and Mannslieb are risen and bright in the night, thinning the veil that separates the mortal realm from the other planes of existence. It is no coincidence that on one such Geheimnisnacht Eve, the hallowed Dwarf Slayer Gotrek and his mannish companion and chronicler Felix Jaeger detected and defeated a Slaaneshi cult, only to find themselves transported to the Realm of Chaos to face more horrors at the whim of the insidious Prince of Pleasure. His gamesmaster – a Keeper of Secrets – must be found and killed for Slaanesh’s foul game to finally end.	false
